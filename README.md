**Notes:**

* This is my initial submission to be graded. 
* I had a bug in my code in the early evening hours that make me revert some updates, aabout about user can view following/followers. I will try to re-add that tonight and submit my code changes. To me this was the most difficult week, because I found working with fragments and communicating with fragments a bit difficult to grasp. I'm glad I was able to complete the assignment and learn this very important component of android develpment.
